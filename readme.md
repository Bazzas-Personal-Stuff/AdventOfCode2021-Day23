# AoC 2021 - Day 23

This is an interactive game for the Advent of Code 2021 - Day 23 puzzle. It is by no means the "best" way to make this type of game, 
but it does the job.

## Controls:

- **Click a cell:** Select cell
- **Arrow Keys:** Move selected cell
- **A, B, C, D:** Change selected cell to a new value
- **Z:** Undo moves
- **R:** Reset the game. Modified cells keep their new values.
- **P:** Show replay of your moves

This implementation does not enforce all of the game's movement rules. Detailed rules can be found here: [https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/23]()
